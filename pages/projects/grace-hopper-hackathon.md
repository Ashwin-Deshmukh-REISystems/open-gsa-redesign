GSA was joined by coders from across the region as we came together in celebration of Grace Hopper’s birthday. Admiral “Amazing Grace” Hopper was one of the first programmers in the history of computers. As the creator of the first compiler for a programming language, it is largely due to her that programmers use “if/thens” instead of 1s and 0s today.

This event was hosted by GSA’s IT Digital Service team at the NARA Innovation Hub.

## The Challenge

The competition was for all open source contributors to redesign the GSA Open website, open.gsa.gov. Open.gsa.gov is the current developer portal for all GSA data, APIs, and source code open to the public.

The goal of the redesign was to improve public engagement with GSA digital assets and increase understanding and awareness of agency open technology. GSA challenged developers and designers from industry, academia, and federal government to create solutions using the site product roadmap provided on the competition details webpage.

## The Teams

We came together for one day to form small teams and work collaboratively to solve coding and design problems. GSA Digital Service team members were onsite to give guidance and answer any team questions.

## The Prizes

Judges selected 1 winning team to win cash prizes of $1000 per team member.

The winners were the team of John Hillegass, Mark Ostrander, Patrick Knowlan, Beverly Blank, Julia Ouimet of Team Grace.100!!
