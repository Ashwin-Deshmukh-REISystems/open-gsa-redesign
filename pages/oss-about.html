banner-heading: About GSA Open Source Software
banner-text: We believe in being "open first" with working to realize 100% open source code across the Agency. While we may be a little ways away from being fully 100% open source, we take pride in being the government standard for open sourcing.  What we create is the people's code! Likewise, what we do should be transparent and available to the public. So please, explore some of our public data&mdash;innovate, create, and make sure to give us your feedback.

#### About

<p dir="ltr">This site outlines GSA's response to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf" target="_blank">M-16-21</a> memo, Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Our current <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/GSAOSSPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">policy</a> outlines how we are realizing one of our GSA IT Vision elements of "Be Open."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Besides the writing and posting of our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/GSAOSSPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">policy</a>, we have multiple efforts underway to implement it.</p>

<ol>
    <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">We have a two mini-projects underway: 1.) automation of the OSS inventory to place on gsa.gov/code.json and open.gsa.gov/code.json; and, 2.) automation to review files within repositories for sensitive information before making the repository public and making private repositories that are found to have sensitive content until they can be cleaned.</p>

    <p dir="ltr">We are redesigning <a href="http://open.gsa.gov" target="_blank"> open.gsa.gov</a> including one of its major components, Code.  This is the theme of our upcoming <a href="http://open.gsa.gov/grace-hopper-hackathon/" target="_blank">Hackathon</a>.</p>
