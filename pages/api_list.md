GSA's Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) cover a range of important data and functionality. Software developers and researchers can use these resources to help people find useful government information.

Many of our APIs are themselves open sourced and we always [welcome feedback](https://github.com/GSA/GSA-APIs/issues "Create an issue"). If you have any questions or ideas for how we can improve our APIs, don't hesitate to let us know.
