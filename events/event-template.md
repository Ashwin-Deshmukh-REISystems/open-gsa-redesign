intro: Join coders from across the region as we come together in celebration of Grace Hopper’s birthday. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Admiral “Amazing Grace” Hopper</a> was one of the first programmers in the history of computers. As the creator of the first compiler for a programming language, it is largely due to her that programmers use “if/thens” instead of 1s and 0s today.
challenge: The competition is for all open source contributors to redesign the GSA Open website, <a href="http://open.gsa.gov/">open.gsa.gov</a>. Open.gsa.gov is the current developer portal for all GSA data, APIs, and source code open to the public.<br>The goal of this redesign is to improve public engagement with GSA digital assets and increase understanding and awareness of agency open technology. GSA challenges developers and designers from industry, academia, and federal government to create solutions using the site product roadmap provided on the competition details webpage.
howitworks: We'll come together for one day to form small teams, usually 2-5 people, and work collaboratively to solve coding and design problems.  You can show up with a team or find a few folks to form a team when you get there. Designers and developers of all skills levels are welcome. GSA Digital Service team members will be onsite to give guidance and answer any team questions.
prizes: Judges will select up to 3 winning teams (no more than 5 participants each) to win cash prizes of as much as $1000 per team member.
