## Overview
Legacy FPDS-NG offers Web Services to the Public Users for them to receive Contract and Referential data. Public Users are the type of users that are not associated with a Federal Government agency and that do not post data to FPDS-NG. Hence, very limited access is given to them.

Legacy FPDS-NG allows Public User accounts (User Type = P) to be created with the default 'General Public' role that will help them to access 'Final' Public and 'Final' DoD unrevealed 'Contract Data', and 'Referential Data'. Public Users must send User ID, Password and Service Originator ID in their Web Service requests sent to legacy FPDS-NG.

Legacy FPDS-NG performs User Authentication to check if the Public User ID exists with an associated Password. Additionally, it performs the Mandatory, Format, Draft or Final record and DoD revealed or unrevealed data checks, and returns the appropriate error messages.
